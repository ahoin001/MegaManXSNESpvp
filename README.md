See the [co-op validation notes](docs/coop-port.md) for current limits.

## Quick start (pre-built release)

1. Download the latest [Windows ZIP or Linux AppImage](https://github.com/mstan/MegaManXSNESRecomp/releases/latest).
   Extract the ZIP on Windows, or make the AppImage executable on Linux.
2. Open the launcher and select your own **Mega Man X (USA) (Rev 1)** ROM
   (`.sfc` or `.smc`). Headered and unheadered ROMs are supported.
3. Configure your keyboard or controller in **Controls**.
4. Enable the features you want in **Mods**, then select **Play**.

For Zero or co-op, select your own **Mega Man X3 USA ROM** in Mods. The X3
weapon mod shares that selection. X2 weapons need your **Mega Man X2 USA ROM**.
Assets are extracted automatically on your machine.

Select **Modern** under **Zero behavior** in either Zero mod for saber combat
and extra aerial movement. **X3 Behavior** is the default. **Add Zero** and
**X / Zero Co-op** are alternatives; enabling one disables the other.

For widescreen, enable **Widescreen** in Mods and choose your view aspect.
**Display Aspect** in Settings controls pixel proportions. Netplay uses the
original view or fixed 16:9, 21:9, or 32:9.

Setup guides: [Zero](docs/zero-0.0.1.md), [X2/X3 weapons](docs/x-weapons-port.md),
[password saves](docs/password-saves.md), and [netplay](docs/netplay.md).
No ROMs or extracted assets are included in the downloads.

## Play versus, from a fresh install

Versus uses the same launcher as the story game. You bring the ROMs. The
download does not include them.

1. Install the game the same way as the [quick start](#quick-start-pre-built-release).
   Open the launcher and select your **Mega Man X (USA) (Rev 1)** ROM.
2. Open **Mods**, enable **X / Zero Co-op**, and select your **Mega Man X3
   USA** ROM on that mod. Co-op will not start without it. Assets extract on
   your machine the first time.
3. Optional: enable **X2 weapons** and **X3 weapons** and point each one at
   your own USA ROM for that game. The X3 weapon mod can reuse the X3 ROM you
   already picked. Those packs add the specials you can fire in the match.
4. Open **Controls**. Player 1 needs a keyboard or a controller before any
   match. For a same-room match, player 2 needs one too, unless you use the
   **Couch** button below, which assigns a free second gamepad or the player 2
   keyboard for you.

**Add Zero** and **X / Zero Co-op** cannot both be on. Versus turns co-op on
and turns Add Zero off.

### Same room

1. Choose **Netplay**.
2. Select **Couch**.
3. The game launches on this PC. Controller 1 is X. Controller 2 is Zero.
   Both players can use every weapon you enabled. There is no lobby and no
   three-weapon pick.

Start the cartridge as usual: title screen, then a stage. Player 2 appears
when the stage has a safe place to land. The arena begins once both players
are in that stage.

### Online

Both players need the same build, their own X1 USA Rev 1 ROM, and their own
X3 USA ROM. Each person only configures **Player 1** on that computer. The
room assigns the seat.

1. Choose **Netplay**, then online or LAN.
2. Select **Versus**. The room is named Versus if you leave the name blank.
3. The host starts the room. The other player joins it.
4. Each player picks three weapons. The match will not start until both picks
   are in. Player 1's seat is X. Player 2's seat is Zero.
5. The host starts the match.

The room stays on one shared screen. Separate cameras are for campaign co-op,
not for Versus.

### What the match is

The fight is best of three. A round ends when one player runs out of health,
holds for about two seconds, then both players respawn with the same health
they started with. Specials recharge on a timer instead of spending weapon
energy. The buster stays available.

The camera locks to one screen around the two players. Enemies and their
shots are cleared, and story scenes do not freeze the fight. The floor, walls,
and any pits or spikes are still the stage you entered. There is no separate
arena map yet. Pick a flat part of a stage if the entrance is a bad duel spot.

Campaign co-op is unchanged. Leave **Match rules** on **Campaign**, or never
press **Couch** or **Versus**, and you still play the story together.

## Controls and co-op

Use the launcher's **Controls** screen to assign devices and remap buttons for
each player. Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch Pro controllers are supported.
For couch co-op, assign a controller or keyboard to each player. For netplay,
configure your local **Player 1** controls; the lobby assigns your game seat.

P2 joins automatically at a safe stage entrance in co-op. Hold P2 **Select**
for 1.5 seconds to withdraw, and tap it to rejoin. A player who dies remains out
until the next stage or a team restart.

Reopen the launcher during play with **Ctrl+L** or controller **Select+L3**.
Configure system shortcuts in **Hotkeys**. **F7** opens the save-state browser
and **F8** opens rewind; both pause gameplay while you choose.

## Reporting problems

[Open an issue](https://github.com/mstan/MegaManXSNESRecomp/issues) with your
build, enabled mods, and steps to reproduce the problem. For gameplay bugs,
include a nearby save state and describe the inputs that trigger it.

Windows diagnostics are saved beside the executable in
`logs/mmx-<date>-<time>-<process-id>.log`; read-only installations use
`%TEMP%/MegaManXSNESRecomp/logs`. Attach that log and `last_run_report.json`.
If a crash produced `crash_report_*.json` or `crash_minidump_*.dmp`, include
those too. Grab the reports before running the game again.

For netplay connection problems, enable the **Tier 2 diagnostics** mod
(Developer group) before hosting or joining. Each match then writes
`saves/netplay/net_diag.jsonl` (the transport, whether ICE connected directly,
through STUN or through TURN, and any stalls); attach it with the log. The
file is replaced by the next match.

For intermittent co-op collision problems, tick **Co-op physics diagnostics**
under **Mods > Developer**, then play normally. Attach `logs/coop-physics-*.csv`
and its `.previous.csv` companion if present. During netplay the same mod also
writes `logs/coop-netplay-*.csv` with the same name stem; attach that too, from
both players if possible. This extra tracing is off by default.

<summary>Building from source and technical details</summary>

## Building from source

Release notes belong in the GitHub release description. Do not create or commit
`RELEASE_NOTES*.md` files, or include them in release packages.

Clone with all framework dependencies, then run the idempotent
bootstrap check:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mstan/MegaManXSNESRecomp.git
cd MegaManXSNESRecomp
bash tools/bootstrap.sh
```

The `snesrecomp/` directory is a pinned submodule from
[mstan/snesrecomp](https://github.com/mstan/snesrecomp), and `recomp-ui/`
is the shared launcher UI submodule. If you cloned without
`--recurse-submodules`, `tools/bootstrap.sh` initializes them and their
nested dependencies. The gitlink in this repository is the dependency pin;
there is no separate SHA to keep synchronized.

Generated game C is not redistributed. Before the first build, stage a legally
obtained USA Rev 1 ROM as `mmx.sfc`, then run:

```bash
cp "/path/to/Mega Man X (USA Rev 1).sfc" mmx.sfc
bash tools/regen.sh usa --no-tests
```

On Windows 10 or newer, install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) with the
mingw64 toolchain (`cmake`, `ninja`), the SDL3 development package, Git,
Python 3.9 or newer, and `rustup`. Run the bootstrap and regeneration steps
from Git Bash, then:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-recompui -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/SDL3/x86_64-w64-mingw32
cmake --build build-recompui
# or, packaged: SDL3_MINGW_ROOT=/path/to/SDL3 bash tools/build-windows-mingw.sh VERSION
```

SDL3 is the default. SDL2 remains an explicitly supported fallback: configure
a separate tree with `-DSNESRECOMP_SDL_BACKEND=SDL2`.

Windows releases use CMake/MinGW with the shared recomp-ui launcher
(`tools/make_release.ps1`). CMake is the maintained build definition on every
platform. Visual Studio users can open the repository as a CMake project or
configure with the Visual Studio generator and an MSVC-compatible SDL package.
The former manually maintained solution and source list have been retired.

### macOS / Linux (CMake)

Builds natively on macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel) and Linux with clang/gcc.
On macOS, install dependencies with
`brew install cmake sdl3 ninja python3`. On Ubuntu/Debian, install
`build-essential cmake ninja-build libsdl3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev python3`.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-dev -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build-dev --target MegaManXSNESRecomp
ctest --test-dir build-dev --output-on-failure
```

On Linux, `tools/build-linux-dev.sh` wraps those steps for a `build-linux/`
tree. It checks the toolchain, submodules, SDL3/SDL2 and generated code first
and prints the fix for anything missing, reuses the build directory, and can
stage and verify a ROM, regenerate, run the unit tests or launch the game:

```bash
bash tools/build-linux-dev.sh --rom /path/to/mmx.sfc   # first build from a ROM
bash tools/build-linux-dev.sh                           # incremental rebuild
bash tools/build-linux-dev.sh --tests --run             # test, then play
bash tools/build-linux-dev.sh --setup-host --tests      # ROM-free, like CI
```

See `bash tools/build-linux-dev.sh --help` for every option.

On macOS, add `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix)"` if CMake does not find
Homebrew's SDL3. Apple Silicon contributors running an x86_64-translated shell
must also configure with `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64`. Packaging helpers
detect the native hardware architecture and are documented by
`bash tools/build-macos.sh --help` and `bash tools/build-linux.sh --help`.
The cross-platform Windows release can be built with MinGW using
`SDL3_MINGW_ROOT=/path/to/SDL3 bash tools/build-windows-mingw.sh VERSION`.
All release packages are ROM-free; place your legally obtained ROM beside the
executable or AppImage after extraction.
CI compiles both launcher/setup hosts without ROM-derived sources using
`-DSNESRECOMP_SETUP_HOST=ON`, plus the display geometry and widescreen policy
checks. A setup host cannot run the game until its generated sources are built.
For the focused real-ROM state check, add `-DMMX_STATE_TESTS=ON`, build
`mmx_state_tests`, then run:

```bash
python snesrecomp/runner/tests/run_mmx_state_tests.py \
  --exe build-dev/mmx_state_tests --rom mmx.sfc
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for dependency development, validation,
and pull-request guidance.

macOS builds use the same SDL3 + CMake path as Linux. A native macOS
backend (Metal presentation, `GameController.framework`,
Core Audio output) and an optional in-game display menu were contributed
in [PR #10](../../pull/10) and are staged on per-feature branches; they
land after the shared launcher-UI restructure settles.

### Adaptive widescreen support

The adaptive widescreen renderer has been playtested through the ending on Windows. Enable **Widescreen**
on the launcher's **Mods** page. It is disabled by default; existing enabled
widescreen installations automatically use the replacement.

Choose **Adaptive** to fit the window, or **16:9**, **21:9**, or **32:9** for a
fixed view aspect. **Settings → Display Aspect** controls pixel and sprite
proportions in every mode: **4:3 (CRT)**, **8:7 (Square pixels)**, or
**1:1 (Square frame)**. For example, a 16:9 view with 8:7 selected shows more
scenery with square pixels. Adaptive follows the window's shape while preserving
the selected pixel proportions. The view is bounded by the native 256 pixels and
the renderer's 1024-pixel capacity; outside those bounds it is boxed to preserve
pixel shape. Health bars anchor to the screen edges, and expanded sprite
capacity draws sprites beyond the original frame limit. Menus and other native
screens remain pillarboxed. View aspect is the mod's only option.

The original stage camera, collision and encounter timing are preserved, with
scoped fixes for objects exposed by the wider view. The former legacy renderer
selector has been removed. Rockman X (Japan) continues to use its authentic view.

With the widescreen mod disabled, **Display Aspect** also determines the overall
shape of the native frame. With it enabled, **Mods → View aspect ratio** chooses
the view shape and **Display Aspect** continues to determine pixel shape.
Released saves and adaptive-playtest saves remain loadable. F7/F8 open the shared
save browser and rewind; the corresponding old slot loads are now F11/F12.

The S-DSP retains the SNES BRR predictor filters and canonical four-tap
Gaussian interpolation. Host-rate conversion uses continuous interpolation
instead of nearest-sample hold. The current SPC700 core is instruction-cycle
stepped with canonical opcode timing; a sub-cycle bsnes-style SPC700 core is a
separate emulator-core replacement and is not represented as complete here.

The supported packaged workflow is:

```bash
bash tools/build-macos.sh --rom "/path/to/your/rom.sfc" --regen --no-dmg
```

The script builds an arm64 `.app` by default; use `--arch universal` for an
Intel/Apple Silicon package. The ROM is used only for local regeneration and
is never copied into release output.

The recompiled C in `src/gen/` is **not** committed — contributors must
regenerate it from a local ROM before the first build. See the next
section.

### Regenerating the recompiled C (contributors)

1. Stage a legally-obtained USA Rev 1 ROM as `mmx.sfc` at the repo root
   (`.gitignore` excludes it), or pass it to `tools/build-macos.sh --rom`.
2. Run `bash tools/regen.sh usa --no-tests` (drives the recompiler over every
   `recomp/bank*.cfg` and writes `src/gen/bankXX_v2.c` + `dispatch_v2.c`).
   The script builds and requires the fast native analyzer by default; set
   `SNESRECOMP_ANALYSIS_BACKEND=python` only to use the slower reference path.
   On Windows without bash, invoke the underlying tool directly:
   ```bash
   python snesrecomp/tools/build_native_analyzer.py
   python snesrecomp/tools/v2_emit.py --rom mmx.sfc --cfg-dir recomp --out-dir src/gen --cfg-roots --analysis-backend native
   ```
3. Rebuild as above.

For Rockman X (Japan v1.1), stage `rockmanx.sfc` under
`variants/jp/roms/` and run `bash tools/regen.sh jp --no-tests`. The JP path
uses its checked-in LLE coverage profile as optional AOT input; variants the
compiler cannot prove remain on the authoritative interpreter fallback.
`bash tools/regen.sh all` regenerates both regions.

## What "static recompilation" means here

The 65816 CPU code from the ROM is statically translated to C — every
function the analysis can prove is a real generated C function in
`src/gen/`. Execution is **LLE-first**: an authoritative 65816
interpreter (LakeSnes-derived, MIT) is the correctness floor, and the
statically compiled bodies are exact, proven materializations on top of
it — anything the static pass cannot prove keeps running through the
interpreter, loudly. **The rest of the SNES is not recompiled** — it's
hardware. PPU rendering, the APU/SPC700 audio coprocessor, DMA and
HDMA channels, hardware register I/O, and bank-mapping run through
snesrecomp's own runner implementations (`snesrecomp/runner/`). Same
model as N64Recomp and similar projects: recompile the CPU, emulate the
silicon.

The ROM is **never** redistributed — you supply your own legally-dumped
copy.

## Repo layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | Runtime C (CPU state glue, NMI orchestration, hand-written bodies for things the framework doesn't recompile). |
| `src/gen/` | Recompiler output (gitignored; regenerated from ROM). |
| `recomp/bank*.cfg` | Per-bank function declarations + hardware hints the framework cannot derive from the ROM alone. |
| `recomp/funcs.h` | Auto-regenerated by `tools/regen.sh`; never hand-edit. |
| `snesrecomp/` | Pinned submodule containing the [snesrecomp framework](https://github.com/mstan/snesrecomp). |
| `recomp-ui/` | Pinned submodule containing the shared, console-agnostic launcher UI. |
| `third_party/` | Remaining game dependencies and their licenses. |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Shared framework build helpers and USA/JP targets. |
| `config.ini` | The config. Generated next to the exe on first run if missing. |
